 * @brief A subclass of BRQTKitVideoPlayer which provides extra functions
 *
 * This class is designed to improve the playback of video files.  BackRow's video player works well on its own, but this one adds custom skipping ability to allow the user to skip around in files in a much better manner.
 * 
 * If the file does not contain chapters, this class is enabled.  The first skip will skip 5 seconds, then 10, then 20, and so on in exponentially increasing order.  The moment the user skips in the opposite direction, the skip time decreases exponentially.
